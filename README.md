# TREK CHEQUE

Trek Cheque helps take the stress out of your adventures - from sharing with friends in real-time chat to splitting expenses, Trek Cheque is your one stop spot to lay important trip details out for everyone to see. Trek Cheque helps you go from planning your trip details, such as dates, accommodation, and how many people to invite, to an easy to read, interactive trip page where you and your friends can confirm your spot, check how much accommodation would cost and split expenses. Once you have finished your trip Trek Cheque will even let you know who owes who what in the least number of transactions.
